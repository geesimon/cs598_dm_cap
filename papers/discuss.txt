Very good presentation and the presenter can clearly explain the ideas using his own language. The losing points are caused by:
1. Presentation is too short (16:38)
2. I don't see the major contribution highlighted in the presentation
3. Presenter does give his own spoken opinion but no slide was given thus make his own opinion not very obvious.
