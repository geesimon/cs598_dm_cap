Very good presentation and the presenter can clearly explain the ideas using his own language. The losing points are caused by:
1. Presentation is too short (16:38)
2. I don't see the major contribution highlighted in the presentation
3. Presenter does give his own spoken opinion but no slide was given thus make his own opinion not very obvious.

Mining Android App Descriptions for Permissions Requirements Recommendation

Great work on explaining the technical details. The slides are very well organized. Given the technical depth of this paper, I guess a real sample could help audience to understand the topic better. I have some questions regarding this presentation.

1. The paper use BM25 to do description similarity check. I'm wondering whether we can use the modern deep learning based approach such as ELMO for text embedding to achieve better results.
2. I guess CLAP would need to provide a good UI for the developer in order to make it useful. But not sure they do have such capability.



Checking App Behavior Against App Descriptions

In the slide "malware detection evaluation", only 56% of malware are correctly detected. It seems the recall of this approach is quite low. Any idea on how effective this approach is compared with others?

Hi Ayan, very good work on explaining the paper. I have 2 questions:
1. What approach is used to construct the semantic dependencies? 
2. I see some aspect templates in the presentation, how these templates were built?
